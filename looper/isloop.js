/*
1. have storage DT arr=[]
2. traverse the LL and push in their values,
3. conditionals: if value exists, return true
    if we get to the tail, return false
4. access each node with getNthNode(n) method
[1,2,3,4,5,6,          7,8,9,10]
            3, 4, 5, 6



EXTRA CREDIT:

Write a function findLoop() that consumes a linkedlist with a loop
This function should return the Node value the loop begins at
Remember to write some test specs too!
